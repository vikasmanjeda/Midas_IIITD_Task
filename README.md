# Midas_IIITD_Task
(Task by MIDAS-IIITD for Summer Internship 2021)

# About the task
To build a model to predict the category.

# Given Dataset
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pLv0fNE4WHokpJHUIs-FTVnmI9STgog05e658qEON0I/edit#gid=1396401268

## Approch to solve 
Step 1. Clean and process the data

Step 2. Visualization of data.

Step 3. Predict the model & measure the accuracy of the model.

Detailed analysis can be found in the notebook [here](https://github.com/vikasmanjeda/Midas_IIITD_Task/blob/main/Task.ipynb)

There are different way to improve the accuracy of the model.
1. More Data: More variety and more volume will give better results.
2. Treat missing: The unwanted presence of missing values in the data often reduces the accuracy of a model. It leads to inaccurate predictions. So, it is important to treat missing value.
3. Multiple algorithms: In Machine learning, there are different types of algorithms to achieve higher accuracy but some algorithms are better suited to a particular type of data sets than others. So, we should apply all relevant models and check the performance.

The algorithms I will use:
1. k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Naive Bayes

For different types of data, I'll train all the 3 Algorithms on them, just to evaluate which one will work better.

# Conclusion
1. Decision trees has higher higher accuracy. 
2. Clothing is most popular product category.
3. Allure Auto has most product in data.
